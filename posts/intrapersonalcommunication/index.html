<li>Per the transactional model which factors contribute to different environments.
<ul>
<li>transactional model: communication is an exchange, and simultaneous unlike the linear model.</li>
<li>environments bring context to the formulation of communicated messages such as ethnic group, classism, intent, experience, or concern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compare/Contrast interpersonal vs impersonal relationships.
<ul>
<li>interpersonal
<ul>
<li><em>quantitatively</em> face to face, and two interacting are a dyad i.e. asking for directions</li>
<li><em>qualitatively</em>, interpersonal communication occurs when members treat each other as unique individuals (Kant?)
<ul>
<li>complement to this qualitative approach is <em>impersonal communication</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Contrast</strong>: uniqueness, rules/roles, relational culture, irreplace-ability, interdependence, disclosure, and intrinsic rewards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Definition and characteristics of competent communicators
<ul>
<li>competent communicators achieve one&rsquo;s goals in a way that enhances relationships it&rsquo;s involved with, or effective and appropriate</li>
<li>characteristics include being able to apply a wide range of behaviors, choosing the most appropriate, skillful performance, cognitive complexity, empathy, self-monitoring, and commitment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Content and Relational messages
<ul>
<li>content: information being discussed</li>
<li>relational: how you feel about the other person</li>

</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interpersonal communication</strong> is a transactional process involving participants who occupy different but overlapping environments and create meaning and relationships through the exchange of messages, many of which are affected by external, physiological, and psychological noise</li>

<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Emotions have several dimensions. They are signaled by internal physiologi- cal changes, manifested by nonverbal reactions, and defined in most cases by cognitive interpretations. We can use this information to make choices about whether or not to verbalize our feelings. There are several reasons why people do not verbalize many of the emotions they feel. Some people have personalities that are less prone toward emotional expression. Culture and gender also have an effect on the emotions we do and don’t share with others. Social rules and roles discourage the expression of some feelings, particularly negative ones. Social media may also increase the intensity of emotions for both message senders and receivers. Finally, contagion can lead us to experience emotions that we might not otherwise have had. Because total expression of emotions is not appropriate, several guidelines help define when and how to express emotions effectively. Expanding your emotional vocabulary, becoming more self-aware, and expressing mixed feelings are important. Recognizing the difference between feeling, thinking, and acting, as well as accepting responsibility for feelings instead of blaming them on others, lead to better reactions. Choosing the proper time and place to share feelings is also important, as is choosing the best channel for expressing emotions. Whereas some emotions are facilitative, others are debilitative and inhibit effective functioning. Many of these debilitative emotions are biological reactions rooted in the amygdala portion of the brain, but their negative impact can be altered through rational thinking. It is often possible to communicate more confidently and effectively by identifying troublesome emotions, identifying the activating event and self-talk that triggered them, and reappraising any irrational thoughts with a more logical analysis of the situation. It is also important to identify and enjoy facilitative emotions.</p>

<h3 id="summary-1">Summary:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Language is both a marvelous communication tool and the source of many interpersonal problems. Every language is a collection of symbols governed by a variety of rules: semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic. Terms used to name people influence the way the people are regarded. The terms used to name speakers and the language they use reflect the level of affiliation of a speaker toward others. Language patterns also reflect and shape a speaker’s perceived power. Some language habits—such as confusing facts with opinions or inferences and using emotive terms—can lead to unnecessary disharmony in interpersonal relationships. Language also acknowledges or avoids the speaker’s acceptance of responsibility for his or her thoughts and feelings. There are some differences in the ways men and women speak. The content of their conversations varies, as do their reasons for communicating and their conversational styles. However, not all differences in language use can be accounted for by the speaker’s biological sex. Gender roles, occupation, social philosophy, and orientation toward problem solving also influence people’s use of language. Different languages often shape and reflect the views of a culture. Some cultures value directness, brevity, and the succinct use of language, whereas others value indirect or elaborate forms of speech. In some societies, formality is important, whereas others value informality. Beyond these differences, there is evidence to support linguistic relativism—the notion that language exerts a strong influence on the worldview of the people who speak it.</p>
